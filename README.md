# Lunaris Linux
This distribution is made possible by the amazing distributions and Arch Linux specifically and Linus Torvalds himself for making Linux what it is today, this wouldn’t be possible without the amazing community and their dedication to open-source innovation and obviously their dedication for making things free.

Lunaris, is a Linux distribution, which 'efficiently' packs together all the features from other distributions, like Arch's flexibility, NixOS's declaration of configurations, Debian's reliability.

# Mooncrate
It also contains a superior cross-distribution package manager called mooncrate, works as the front-end for the AUR, Official Arch repositories, Debian repositories and NixOS's repositories. Making sure all packages are available in the best format.

Unlike other distros mooncrate, allows you to run multiple instances of it at a time, unlike most others. By allocating the database required to install, before installing, letting the other manager run smoothly, you can perform a database defrag, to ensure the databases are clean.

mooncrate also allows, you to select the distribution repositories to install from, default is Arch since, the distribution is mostly based on Arch...

# Custom Linux kernel
Lunaris uses a modified version of the Linux kernel based on Arch and NixOS's Linux kernel... but you can also tweak, recompile, or install a completely different kernel, the default kernel is designed to work with all low-end and mid-range hardware, there is no official report for high-end hardware yet.

# UEFI, TPM 2.0, Secure Boot
TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and UEFI support are included for security, but you can disable them if you're feeling adventurous, or on lower end or older hardware.

# Principles of Lunaris (Based on arch)

**Simplicity**  
Lunaris embraces simplicity by keeping things clean and straightforward. We ship software as close to the original upstream versions as possible, with minimal changes, and avoid unnecessary additions. The system is designed to let users configure everything themselves, with a focus on using the command line and text editors. No frills, just the essentials for users who want full control over their system.

**Modernity**
Lunaris, like Arch is all about staying up-to-date with the latest stable releases, ensuring that your system is always current without breaking things along the way. It follows a rolling-release model for all supported packages, so you get continuous updates after the initial installation, without the need for major version upgrades.

Lunaris embraces modern technologies, incorporating the latest features available to Linux users. From custom init systems and cutting-edge file systems to LVM2, software RAID, and udev support, Lunaris ensures that your system is not only current but optimized for performance. It also ships with the latest stable kernel, providing the best hardware support and features available.

**User-Centric**  
Unlike many GNU/Linux distributions that focus on being _user-friendly_, Lunaris, like Arch, is all about being _user-centric_. The goal is to cater to those who are actively involved in shaping the system, not to appeal to everyone. Lunaris is designed for users who have a strong understanding of Linux or those with a do-it-yourself mindset—people who are comfortable diving into the documentation and solving problems on their own. It’s about empowering users to take control and build a system that truly fits their needs, without compromising on flexibility or customization.

**Versatility**  
Lunaris is a versatile, general-purpose distribution that gives users the freedom to create their ideal system. From a minimal installation to a fully customized setup, Lunaris offers a flexible platform with a unified package manager that supports multiple ecosystems (apt, pacman, nix). Whether you're building a new server, developer workstation, or just a personal system, Lunaris adapts to your needs.

# Lunaris Might Not Be For You If…

- If you think a Operating System must be independent and not rely on other distributions' repositories or ideologies.
-   You don’t have the time, desire, or inclination to manage a "do-it-yourself" GNU/Linux distribution.
- Issues. Lunaris is a newer project, so you might run into some rough spots or features that are still in the works.
-   You need support for an architecture other than x86_64 as many of the default packages are based on Arch and do not support x86_64.
- If you just want a distro that works out of the box with minimal fuss, Lunaris might feel like overkill with all its customization options and different package managers.
-   You are firmly committed to using a distribution that strictly adheres to free software principles as defined by GNU.
- Occasional Compatibility Issues: Because Lunaris pulls from multiple package ecosystems, you might run into dependency or compatibility issues now and then.
-   You believe an OS should configure itself, run out of the box, and come with a complete set of software and a desktop environment right after installation.
-   You’re not a fan of rolling release systems and prefer a more traditional release cycle.
- Not Beginner-Friendly: Lunaris is more suited for experienced users who enjoy customizing their system. If you’re new to Linux, it might be a bit too complex.
-   You’re already happy with your current operating system and don’t feel the need to switch.

# Why would I want to use Lunaris?

- Because Lunaris, supports all repositories, and is designed to run any package.
- Since it is heavily based on Arch and Arch is the best.
- All-in-One Package Manager: A unified package manager for everything. No more jumping between package managers.
- Custom, Flexible Kernel: A fast and modular kernel that works on both old and new hardware. Plus, you can tweak and customize it to your liking.
- TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and UEFI are included for security, but you can disable them if you don't need it or using, low-end or older hardware.
- Stability of Debian, the customization of Arch, and the declarative nature of NixOS. Lunaris supports a ton of packages and installation methods.

If you’re into flexibility and power and don’t mind a little extra setup, Lunaris could be the distro you’ve been looking for. But if you prefer something more polished and straightforward, there are other options out there.

Thanks for reading the whole thing, we appreciate it
