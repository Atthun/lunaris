Lunaris is like if Debian, Arch, and NixOS had a hybrid, combining the best of all three for a next-gen Linux experience. With a custom kernel, modern package management, and built-in security features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0, Lunaris is built to push the boundaries. Whether you're a power user, developer, or just someone looking for a more flexible Linux distro, Lunaris has you covered.
Why You Might Wanna Try It

    All-in-One Package Manager: A unified package manager for apt, pacman, paru (AUR), and nix. No more jumping between package managers.
    Custom, Flexible Kernel: A fast and modular kernel that works on both old and new hardware. Plus, you can tweak and customize it to your liking.
    Built-in Security (Optional): TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and UEFI are included for security, but you can disable them if you're feeling adventurous.
    Flexibility and Power: Get the stability of Debian, the customization of Arch, and the declarative nature of NixOS. Lunaris supports a ton of packages and installation methods.

Why You Might Not Wanna Use It

    It’s Still Evolving: Lunaris is a newer project, so you might run into some rough spots or features that are still in the works.
    Customization Can Be Overwhelming: If you just want a distro that works out of the box with minimal fuss, Lunaris might feel like overkill with all its customization options and different package managers.
    Occasional Compatibility Issues: Because Lunaris pulls from multiple package ecosystems, you might run into dependency or compatibility issues now and then.
    Not Beginner-Friendly: Lunaris is more suited for experienced users who enjoy customizing their system. If you’re new to Linux, it might be a bit too complex.

If you’re into flexibility and power and don’t mind a little extra setup, Lunaris could be the distro you’ve been looking for. But if you prefer something more polished and straightforward, there are other options out there.
